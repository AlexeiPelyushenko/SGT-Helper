This repository is a simple program to help with studying spectral graph theory. In reality you could use it for any topic but that's why I made it.

Features:
- Add/delete topics
- Add/read/delete information associated with topics
- Data gets saved between sessions

Feel free to clone it. If you want to contribute to the repo either by information in info.json or improving sgt_helper.py, feel free to let me know. It'd be much appreciated.
